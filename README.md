# #34245 -  regex manager only detecting first dependency

## Current behavior

The first depdency is shown in the dependency dashboard and gets updated. But the second one is not listed and therefor not getting any updates.

## Expected behavior

Both dependencies should be listed in the dashboard and getting updates.
